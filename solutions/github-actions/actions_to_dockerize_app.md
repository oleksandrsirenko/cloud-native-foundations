# Dockerize Application with GitHub Actions

For this task, you need to create two secrets in your Docker Hub: DOCKERHUB_USERNAME, and DOCKERHUB_TOKEN respectively. It will provide secure access to your account and the Docker image of the application you've build. Then grab and edit existant `docker-build.yaml` file from solutions to meet you needs (correct the Docker Hub user name, app name, version, etc.)  and put it to the `.github/workflows` directory to execute it.

See details in the tutorial [Dockerize the app with GitHub Actions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rx3N8MImP9k)
