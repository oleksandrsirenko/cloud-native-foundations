# Cloud Native Foundations by Udacity Hands-On Course Materials

---

***Learn how to structure, package, and release an application to a Kubernetes cluster, while using an automated CI/CD pipeline.***

The Cloud Native Foundations course is Phase I of the [SUSE Cloud Native Foundations Scholarship Program](https://www.udacity.com/scholarships/suse-cloud-native-foundations-scholarship) from Udacity.

## About

This repository is an expanded version of the [course materials](https://github.com/udacity/nd064_course_1) with hands-on exercises and detailed step-by-step solutions. It also includes notes on how to fix possible errors that students may encounter while solving problems.

The course focuses on applying good development practices and containerizing an application and its release to a Kubernetes cluster using an automated CI/CD pipeline.

## Prerequisites

- Understand the basics of HTTP (like a client, server, and internet request)
- Basic Python (data types, Functions, REST requests, web development)
- Ability to use Git, Linux machines, and Linux Command Line
- Familiar with Web application development in any language
- Familiarity with Docker and exposure to a CI/CD pipeline are not required for success in this program but are helpful skills to have.

## Course Outline

- Introduction to Cloud Native
- Architecture Considerations
- Container Orchestration
- Open Source PaaS
- Cloud Native CI/CD

## Tools, Environment & Dependencies Checklist

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- [x] Python, using the instractions provided in the [official Python documentation](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [x] Git, using the instractions provided in the [official Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [x] Docker, using the instractions provided in the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [x] Vagrant, using the instractions provided in the [official Vagrant documentation](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads)
- [x] VirtualBox, using the instractions provided in the [official VirtualBox documentation](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads). Make sure that you have installed VirtualBox in `6.1.16` or a higher version.

## How to Use

All supporting materials and the curriculum can be found in the exercises directory, where each subfolder consists of the skeleton code and the markdown file describing the particular exercise. All solutions in the directory of the same name are supported with notes on possible errors and how to fix them.

- try to solve each problem according to the instructions
- if you get stuck, feel free to check the solution, reproduce it using the instructions in the specific `solution.md` file, compare with the provided code, and test.

## Recomendations

The current solutions have been created and tested on [Ubuntu 20.04](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) as IDE. While most of this stuff will work on Windows, it will take a lot of work to debug and solve some unusual problems, so I highly recommend using a Unix-like operating system based on the Linux kernel. This will save you a lot of time and hassle.
