# Cloud Native Foundations by Udacity Hands-On Course Materials

---

***Learn how to structure, package, and release an application to a Kubernetes cluster, while using an automated CI/CD pipeline.***

The Cloud Native Foundations course is Phase I of the [SUSE Cloud Native Foundations Scholarship Program](https://www.udacity.com/scholarships/suse-cloud-native-foundations-scholarship) from Udacity.

## About

This repository is an extended version of the [course materials](https://github.com/udacity/nd064_course_1) with solutions and notes on possible problems/bugs students may face with programming exercises and how to fix them. 

Throughout the course, we will walk through a realistic example of applying good development practices and containerizing an application, before it's released to a Kubernetes cluster using an automated CI/CD pipeline.

## Prerequisites

- Understand the basics of HTTP (like a client, server, and internet request)
- Basic Python (data types, Functions, REST requests, web development)
- Ability to use Git, Linux machines, and Linux Command Line
- Familiar with Web application development in any language
- Familiarity with Docker and exposure to a CI/CD pipeline are not required for success in this program but are helpful skills to have.

## Course Outline

- Introduction to Cloud Native
- Architecture Considerations
- Container Orchestration
- Open Source PaaS
- Cloud Native CI/CD

## Tools, Environment & Dependencies Checklist

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- [x] Python, using the instractions provided in the [official Python documentation](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [x] Git, using the instractions provided in the [official Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [x] Docker, using the instractions provided in the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [x] Vagrant, using the instractions provided in the [official Vagrant documentation](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads)
- [x] VirtualBox, using the instractions provided in the [official VirtualBox documentation](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads). Make sure that you have installed VirtualBox in `6.1.16` or a higher version.

## How to Use

All supporting materials and the curriculum can be found in the exercises directory, where each subfolder consists of the provided skeleton code and the `README.md` file describing the exercises. All solutions in the directory of the same name are supported with notes on possible errors and how to fix them.

- try to solve each problem according to the instructions
- if you get stuck, feel free to check the solutions, reproduce them with a specific `README.md` file, compare them with the provided code, and test.

## Recomendations

The current solutions have been built and tested on [Ubuntu 20.04](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) as IDE. While everything will work on Windows, it will take a lot of work to debug and solve some unusual problems, so I highly recommend using a Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel. This will save you a lot of time and hassle.
